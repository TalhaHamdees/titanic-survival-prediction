# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. Classic binary classification problem from the Kaggle competition.

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, ticket class, etc.

**Dataset:** [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
